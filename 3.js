Each number is in the main 3 digit number refers to a classification and a subclass within that. Decimals afterward are a futher subclass upon the original number, and futher decimals refer to that specific book.

Therefore, it is obvious to say that if I were interested in English Etymology. Then I would search for:
400's - Language
420's - English and Old English
422 - English etymology

After that I just need to look through the books to determine what specific subject matter I would like to read about.
